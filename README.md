Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges! This repository contains my attempts to solve the daily coding puzzles provided during the month of December.

## 📜 About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new programming challenge is released, and participants from around the world compete to solve them using the programming language of their choice.

## 💻 Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:
